We will also explore other forecasting methods, such as the Prophet model developed by Facebook, and machine learning techniques, such as random forests and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect that could have been better is the data cleaning and preprocessing. There were some missing values and inconsistencies in the data that needed to be addressed before we could create an accurate forecast. In the future, we will need to ensure that we have clean and consistent data before proceeding with the forecasting process.\n",

    "Another area for improvement is the incorporation of external factors that could impact consumption, such as holidays, events, and changes in government policies. By including these factors in our forecasting models, we can create more accurate and robust predictions for our energy portfolio."
